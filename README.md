SpawnBox - A collection of ready-to-go VM's for VMware Workstation

If you're a freak like me you're probably messing around a lot with different operating systems and virtual machines. Installing them takes a considerable amount of our sparse free time. That's why I decided to create some ready-to-go boxes that you can import to VMware Workstation right away and get things going!

This project contains several ready-to-go virtual machines with operating systems installed like Windows, Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD & OpenBSD.

More boxes to come!


As of now we got:


- Microsoft Windows 7

- Microsoft Windows 8.1

- Microsoft Windows 10 1909

- Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.4 LTS

- Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS

- Ubuntu Server 18.04.4 LTS

- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS

- OpenBSD 6.4

- OpenBSD 6.5

- OpenBSD 6.6

- FreeBSD 11.3

- FreeBSD 12.1

All boxes are made using VMware Workstation Pro 15.5. The operating systems are all 64-bit in the English language. The Microsoft Windows boxes come without a license.

The purpose of this project is using these boxes for short-term use but if you feel like using them for a longer period of time you should bring your own legal license. The FreeBSD boxes are coming from the official FreeBSD website as they prepared them for us and I'm not here to do double work. That's the whole purpose of this set-up right?!?

The standard username on every box is user or root and the password is Pa$$w0rd

Feel free to send me suggestions what to include more. I might be releasing these boxes for Virtualbox as well soon.
